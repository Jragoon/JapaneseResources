# Guide to learning Japanese => step-by-step

# Web browser extensions
I absolutely recommend: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rikaichamp/. This extension is amazing- if there's ever anything that you'd like to read but you would rather not look it up, you can hover your mouse over. It'll tell you the readings as well as the meaning. Fantastic tool.

# Grammar
Kamerman's textbook: https://pomax.github.io/nrGrammar/ is the best online resource that I've found so far. Fantastic, free textbook.
You don't have to read it all at once, but use it as a reference to base your studies around.

# Listening
Of course, watching anime you're familiar with and using native subtitles! This works especially well if you choose slice of life shows.

Honestly, I wish there was a consistent way to do this, but it depends on your interests.
I would recommend getting your feet wet with music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHsUaS9r5R8 even if you can't quite make most of it out yet.
There are plenty of cool artists out there you may never have heard of. Listening to music can help you get used to pronounciations / just be plain fun!

The best way is consuming lots of media you enjoy, even if you can't understand it completely. If there's nothing particular that strikes your interest, I would recommend starting with something like: https://learnjapanesepod.com/

# Speaking
I'll practice with you!

# Kanji
If you want to study, Kanji is a huge boon to understanding the language. Even learning the first 100 kanji will be extremely helpful in getting started with consuming media. For this nothing beats https://kanji.garden/ for me. If you use this site, make sure to go to Settings -> Reviews and turn on both "Learn in Stages" and "Type Reading Answers".
